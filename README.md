## Introduction
This is the MATLAB implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper "Cryo-Electron Microscopy Image Denoising Using Multi-Frequency Vector Diffusion Maps." 

## Package Required
This implementation requires ASPIRE package to perform the preprocessing steps and initial classification and alignment, which can be downloaded from http://spr.math.princeton.edu/

## Getting Started
In MATLAB, Please check
