## Introduction
This is the MATLAB implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper "<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9506435">_Cryo-Electron Microscopy Image Denoising Using Multi-Frequency Vector Diffusion Maps_</a>" by Yifeng Fan and Zhizhen Zhao.

## Package Required
This implementation requires **ASPIRE** package to perform the preprocessing steps and initial classification and alignment, which can be downloaded from http://spr.math.princeton.edu/

## Getting Started
In MATLAB, Please check
~~~
demo.m 
~~~
in the root directory, which includes an example of the whole denoising processes by using MFVDM algorithm.
