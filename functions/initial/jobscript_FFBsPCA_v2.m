%Description:
% Computes Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients 'coeff', and filtered steerable PCA expansion coefficients 'sPCA_coeff'.
%Input:
%	data: image dataset.
%	c: band limit

%Output
%	timing: toc_FFBsPCA: the whole time spent on computing fast steerable PCA. toc_sPCA: time for steerable PCA. toc_FBcoeff: time for computing Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients
%	coeff: Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients
%	mean_coeff: mean of the Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients
%	sPCA_coeff: steerable PCA expansion coefficients
%	U: eigenvectors of C^{(k)}'s
%	D: eigenvalues of C^{(k)}'s.
